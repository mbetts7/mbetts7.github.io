The day started off in familiar territory.  I had used nested resources and nested forms with [accepts_nested_attributes_for](http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/NestedAttributes/ClassMethods.html#method-i-accepts_nested_attributes_for) before in my first [project](https://settleup.me).  By lunch time, I was tired and my cold was settling in.  I craved sweatpants.  I also had been wanting to make a blog for entirely too long.  I have blog posts written that have never seen the light of day.  I am in my 6th week of a programming bootcamp at General Assembly, it's about damn time.

So I get home, cook some lunch, throw on some sweats.  First I grab one of the many quick blog tutorials, run through it and create a blog.  Add a few features and some foundation styling.  Quickly realizing that this isn't exactly going to be a function a blog that I will use.  So I start researching rails blogging platforms, gems, etc.  [Publify](https://github.com/publify/publify) looks like old faithful.  But [Octopress](http://octopress.org/docs/) is newer and pretty intriguing for many reasons:

Some of the advantages of Octopress:

* I can easily backdate my blogposts that I wrote ages ago and never published
* Ultimate control
* Comes with a bunch of plugins, like Twitter and GitHub integration, Disqus comments, deployment tasks and others
* The site is just static HTML which is much faster than dynamically generated content
* Automatically responsive design, albeit I need to change to a template or create my own asap since every octopress site looks like this...due to the fact that almost all octopress users must hate front-end'
* Tons of default plugins that make bloggin easy.  Like throwing a kitten off ot the right with code like this:
  `{% img right http://placekitten.com/300/500 150 250 Place Kitten #3 %}`

Mainly I just want control and Octopress gives you that for sure...

The main drawback is that donâ€™t have access to any sort of web-based front-end to work on the site. You can only update the site from the computer where the software is.
